Cache Is The New RAM

Quotes:
    
    That hot spare was too tempting to leave sitting idle, of course. Once the business analysts realized they could run gigantic queries on live production data without touching production, the so-called “hot spare” became nearly as busy and mission-critical as the production copy. We told ourselves it would be fine because if the spare is ever needed we can just take it from them for the duration of the emergency. But that’s like saying you don’t really need to carry a spare tire because you can always steal one from another car.
    
    You know things are really desperate when “less painful than writing it yourself” is the main selling point....What used to be a SQL query written by the business folks turned into hand-written reporting code maintained by the developers.
    
    To paraphrase Paul Graham’s unbearably smug comment about Lisp: once you add group by, filter, & join, you can no longer claim to have invented a new query language, only a new dialect of SQL. With worse syntax and no optimizer.
    
    Those who ignore computer history are condemned to GOTO 1
